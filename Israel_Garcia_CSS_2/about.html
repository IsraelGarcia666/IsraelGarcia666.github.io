        <p>Mexican Heavy Metal Guitarist & Composer, Guillermo Jacome (b. November 6, 1977)
           stands out as one of Mexico’s most versatile and respected guitarists in the heavy metal scene. 
           Since the beginning of his career in 1992, he has explored hard rock, blues, and classic rock, earning 
           recognition across Latin America and beyond.<br>
          <br>
          He first gained prominence with Lvzbel (1998–2009), touring extensively through the U.S., Mexico, 
          Central, and South America. From 2009 to 2012, he joined Raxas, recording the album Instinto and 
          expanding his creative range. Later, between 2013 and 2018, he collaborated with Mario Ian 
          (ex–Rata Blanca), serving as lead guitarist on North American tours.<br>
          Alongside his performance career, Jacome has contributed to music education as a guitar instructor 
          at the Elohim Corona Academy, mentoring young musicians. Most recently, since 2023, he has performed 
          with Gabriel Marian (ex–Rata Blanca) and David Chirino (La Ley), bringing his sound to audiences 
          across Mexico.<br>
          <br>
          His discography includes En vivo y Desnudo (Vol. 1 & 2), Tiempo de la Bestia 
          (soundtrack for Guerrero callejero), Tributo a Judas Priest & Tentaciones, with Lvzbel. 
          Evangelio Nocturno (Remake), with Evangelium, and Instinto with Raxas.<br>
          Celebrated for his powerful riffs and melodic versatility, Guillermo Jacome blends rock 
          influences with heavy metal intensity. His collaborations with leading figures of the 
          Latin American heavy metal movement and his dedication to teaching have secured his legacy 
          as performer and mentor.
